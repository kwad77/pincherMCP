// #1391 v0.85: why_empty — cross-tool diagnostic composite. Phase 4
// composite #5 (final).
//
// Today (atomic). Agent receives an empty response, has to manually
// inspect _meta.empty_reason + _meta.diagnosis, then decide whether
// to re-issue with widened filters, re-index, or pivot. Today that
// decision requires either prompting the model with the catalog or
// firing several follow-up tools to figure out what went wrong:
//
//   list                            → which projects are indexed?
//   doctor                          → is the index healthy?
//   health                          → is the binary stale?
//   search broader filters          → was the query too narrow?
//
// Composite. why_empty(prior_empty_reason, prior_args?) returns:
//
//   {
//     "empty_reason":         "<the input>",
//     "diagnosis":            "<concrete recovery action>",
//     "recovery_steps":       [{"tool":"...", "args":"...", "why":"..."}],
//     "catalog_url":          "docs/empty-reasons.md#<anchor>",
//     "project_health":       {...}  // optional, when applicable
//   }
//
// The composite has no DB query of its own — it's a stateless
// look-up against the catalog in docs/empty-reasons.md, surfaced via
// the matching recovery-steps array. Read-only, idempotent.
//
// The agent's workflow:
//   1. Some tool returns _meta.empty_reason = "X"
//   2. Agent calls why_empty(prior_empty_reason="X")
//   3. why_empty returns the recovery_steps for that reason
//   4. Agent fires one of the recovery_steps
//
// Replaces the regex-match-prose + N tool calls + catalog-lookup
// sequence with one round trip.

// whyEmptyEntry is the structured recovery information for a single
// empty_reason code. Pre-baked from docs/empty-reasons.md so the
// composite doesn't need to read the markdown at runtime.
