// subscriber (#654). It is deliberately tiny: subscribers register a
// buffered channel on connect and drop it on disconnect, and publish is
// non-blocking — a subscriber whose buffer is full misses the event
// rather than stalling the indexer goroutine that called publish.
//
// SSE is best-effort by contract: a missed index_started is corrected
// by the following index_complete, and a reconnecting client re-reads
// the binary_drift snapshot. So dropping under backpressure is the
// right failure mode, not blocking.
