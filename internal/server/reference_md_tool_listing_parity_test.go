// #672 workstream 4 (v0.79 hardening): assert every registered MCP
// tool name appears at least once in docs/REFERENCE.md as a
// backticked code-span. Pre-fix, `context_for_task` (#1259 v0.71)
// was registered + counted in the "23 MCP tools" metadata line but
// had no row in REFERENCE.md's tool tables — the count was right
// but a user reading the tables would only find 22.
//
// Complementary to TestReferenceMD_ToolCountParity (#1506): that
// pins the COUNT, this pins each NAME. Both gates are needed —
// count parity catches "added a tool but the count got stale";
// name parity catches "the count moved but a tool got dropped
// from the tables silently."
//
// Backtick-anywhere is the lenient check — REFERENCE.md uses both
// formal tool-table rows and prose mentions; either counts as
// "documented." A stricter "row in a tool table" test would force
// docs structure decisions on every PR; we already get that via
// the count-parity test.
