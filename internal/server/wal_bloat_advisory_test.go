// #1206 v0.66 DOGFOOD: pincher's WAL is supposed to stay bounded by
// the journal_size_limit=256 MiB SQLite pragma + the indexer-tail
// CheckpointTruncate(). Under sustained concurrent indexing
// pressure, busy readers can pin the WAL across the truncate cycle
// and it grows unbounded. Real-world: an 11GB DB reached a 2.3GB
// WAL. The user has no signal until a tool call latency blows out
// or vacuum reports wal_reader_busy.
//
// Fix: doctor advisories array now surfaces a WAL-bloat warning
// when WAL is past 512 MiB OR > 10% of the DB.
//
// Table-from-the-start (#1152):
//   - Positive: WAL > 512 MiB triggers advisory.
//   - Positive: WAL > 10% of DB triggers advisory even under 512 MiB
//     absolute threshold.
//   - Negative: small WAL (well under threshold) does not trigger.
//   - Cross-check: the advisory text names `pincher vacuum` as the
//     remediation (matches what largeDBAdvisory + #1149 recommend).
