// #558 phase 3: cross-surface parity. Every user-facing CLI subcommand
// that exposes data (as opposed to a pure ops command — `web`,
// `supervised`, `update`, `project`, `health-check`) must have an
// equivalent MCP tool. The HTTP surface is auto-derived from
// s.handlers via /v1/<tool>, so MCP and HTTP parity is enforced
// elsewhere (TestOpenAPI_ParityWithRegisteredHandlers).
//
// Before this gate, `pincher doctor`/`rebuild-fts`/`self-test` were
// CLI-only — agents and dashboards had to shell out. Phase 2 added
// MCP handlers; this test stops them silently regressing.
//
// The ops-only carve-outs are listed explicitly so adding a new
// pure-operation CLI doesn't accidentally trip the gate, and adding a
// new data CLI without an MCP equivalent does.
