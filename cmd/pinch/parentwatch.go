// parentWatchHardExitGrace is how long the watcher waits after calling

// #724: a stdio MCP child (or the supervisor) detects a *graceful*
// parent disconnect via stdin EOF. But a parent killed with SIGKILL,
// crashed, or lost to power-off may not close our stdin pipe — leaving
// us an orphan whose Watch() loop keeps running against the shared DB
// and stomping project metadata (binary_version, schema_version_at_index)
// for every other pincher process. Three such orphans were observed on
// one machine, one of them two days old.
//
// The parent PID is captured once at startup. On Unix a re-parent to
// init moves Getppid() to 1 while the *original* PID is now dead; on
// Windows Getppid() stays stale but the captured PID itself becomes
// dead. Polling pidIsAlive on the captured PID catches both.
//
// onGone is invoked once when the parent is detected gone — pass the
// process's context cancel so shutdown runs cleanly (session-stat flush,
// Watch() teardown). The watcher then waits parentWatchHardExitGrace and
// force-exits as a backstop. A no-op when there is no meaningful parent
// (ppid <= 1) — that includes intentionally-detached servers, which
// must NOT be reaped.

// parentWatchLoop is the testable core of watchParent. On each tick it
// fires onGone (then waits hardExitGrace and calls hardExit) when any
// of these signals reports the original parent gone:
//
//  1. **Reparent signal** (#1321 v0.71): currentPpidFn() != ppid OR
//     <= 1. On Unix, the kernel reparents a child to init/launchd
//     (PID 1) when its real parent dies, so Getppid() will return 1
//     thereafter. This is PID-recycle-immune — the original PID being
//     re-issued to an unrelated process can't fool the reparent check.
//     User repro: three v0.58 stdio MCP children survived 10h / 14h /
//     25h+ after their Claude Code parent disappeared because the
//     pre-fix aliveFn(ppid) saw recycled PIDs as still-alive.
//
//  2. **PID-liveness signal** (pre-fix sole check): aliveFn(ppid) ==
//     false. Catches the macOS edge case where a process group leader
//     holds the PID open without reparenting, and catches Windows
//     (which doesn't reparent — Getppid() stays stale forever after
//     parent death). Kept as belt-and-suspenders.
//
// Returns early (without reaping) when ctx is cancelled — the normal
// shutdown path. Split out so tests can inject fake fns and short
// timings.
