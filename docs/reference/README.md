The long-form reference. The [README](../../README.md) is the pitch + quickstart; this folder is the manual. For 10-minute end-to-end walkthroughs, see [`tutorials/`](../tutorials/) — [Claude Code](../tutorials/claude-code.md), [Cursor](../tutorials/cursor.md), [HTTP dashboard](../tutorials/http-dashboard.md).

**Schema version:** v34 · **MCP tools:** 28 · **Languages detected:** ~25 (AST/parser-tier + regex-tier, plus 1 stub-tier — Haskell; see [Language support](languages.md) for the per-tier breakdown)
